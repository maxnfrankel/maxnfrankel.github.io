# Research Experience

Ye Group (JILA / CU Boulder) | Boulder, CO
:---|---:
Supervisor: Jun Ye | Jul 2023 - Present <img width=200/>
Working on a 3D optical lattice clock project, pushing the limits of atomic clock precision and studying the many-body physics of a fermi-degenerate gas in an optical lattice. | 

Advanced Optical BioImaging Lab (SciLifeLab / Royal Institute of Technology) | Stockholm, Sweden 
:---|---:
Supervisor: Professor Ilaria Testa  | Sep 2022 - May 2023 <img width=200/>
Used a spatial light modulator to create holographic optical focus arrays. The focus array is being implemented in a RESOLFT microscopy setup, used to study live neurons and other cells. |
As a community engagement project, initiated the program “Scientific Research Through an Artist’s Lens,” connecting 16 artists from the Royal Institute of Art with 33 researchers at SciLifeLab in Stockholm, with an exhibition planned at SciLifeLab for April 25th, 2023. | 

Ultracold Quantum Systems Group (Stony Brook University) | Stony Brook, NY 
:---|---:
Mentors: Professor D. Schneble, Dr. M.G. Cohen | Aug 2020 - Aug 2022 <img width=200/>
Designed a system to engineer optical traps for ultracold atoms in a Bose-Einstein condensate. Experimented with holography with a digital micromirror device. |
Additionally, investigated the lineshape of transitions between the magnetic sublevels of the ground state of Rubidium with Prof. Schneble’s guidance, in a double-resonance (optical pumping) setup. |
