I grew surrounded by family involved in the arts. My mother is a painter and taught art classes in NYC for many years, my father is an architect, and my grandmother was a sculptor. I attended the Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts as a visual art student, where I spent four years taking several hours of art classes a day alongside my regular classes.
