I grew surrounded by family involved in the arts. My mother is a painter and taught art classes in NYC for many years, my father is an architect, and my grandmother was a sculptor. I attended the Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts as a visual art student, where I spent four years taking several hours of art classes a day alongside my regular classes.

### Scientific research through an artist’s lens: A collaboration between Stockholm's SciLifeLab and the Royal Institute of Art

[News article on SciLifeLab webiste](https://www.scilifelab.se/news/scientific-research-through-an-artists-lens/)

This program is meant to be an inspirational exchange between 10 artists at KKH and 10 researchers at SciLifeLab. Half of the artists will be post-master’s students who are already practicing artists, and half will be program students at KKH. This program will connect the art and science communities in Stockholm with the aim of creating an opportunity for creative collaboration.

Researchers and artists will participate in three events. The first event is scheduled for February 8th and is meant to introduce the scientists and artists, with quick pitch-presentations by everyone on their work and interests. The second event is a tour of the researchers’ workspaces, guided by each researcher and given to a small group of artists. The lab tours are scheduled for the week of February 13th but can be shifted to fit the schedule of the researcher. If there is mutual interest between a scientist and artist after the lab tours, a collaborative project can be set up on their own terms. The resulting work will be featured in an exhibition at SciLifeLab at the end of April, which is the last event.

This program will be a unique opportunity for outreach at the SciLifeLab. It creates a dialog with artists, lets scientists see how their work and ideas can be visualized, and may lead to increased visibility of their research. For the artists, this program will allow collaboration with leading scientists, giving them the chance to gain inspiring insight at the forefront of research in the life sciences. This program is intended as a pilot, with the goal of being continued in the future, beyond this academic semester, creating compelling and bonding connections between the artistic and scientific communities in Stockholm.

## Development of the program

In my Fulbright application, as my community engagement project, I proposed a collaboration with artists from the Royal Institute of Art (KKH) related to my research in Dr. Ilaria Testa’s lab. The goal was to engage with local artists in Stockholm. After meeting with KKH Professor Johanna Gustafsson Fürst in September and discussing my ideas with the external relations office at SciLifeLab, my community engagement project began to evolve.

Professor Fürst put me in contact with four other professors at KKH: Åsa Andersson Broms, Björn Larsson, Martin Christensen, and Rut Karin Zettergren. I met with them at KKH in October, where they gave me a tour of the art studios and we discussed the project. With the permission of Dr. Testa, Professors Broms, Zettergren, and Larsson toured my lab in November.

Early in December, I reached out to the SciLifeLab external relations team again and proposed a program connecting researchers at SciLifeLab and artists at the KKH. Inspired in part by the exhibition The Life of a Neuron at ARTECHOUSE in New York City, seen a week before I departed for Stockholm, as well as the exhibition Eternal Life at Liljevalchs, which I saw in October, I wanted to create a collaboration between artists and scientists on a scale larger than just my personal research. With approximately 700 researchers working at the Solna campus of SciLifeLab, it seemed like the perfect place for such a project to occur.

The external relations office at SciLifeLab was excited to support the program and has been helping me recruit scientists at the SciLifeLab. We have a news article, application form, and flyers, and we’re looking to select 10 researchers by January 9th. The art professors have written up a program description for KKH students and are selecting 10 artists, 5 post-masters and 5 program students, through their own application process by early January. On December 14th, I gave a presentation to a post-master’s course at the KKH, taught by Professors Broms and Larsson, to generate interest and explain the program, and on December 15th, I announced the program to researchers at SciLifeLab’s WinterFest.
