This program was originally meant to be an inspirational exchange between 10 artists at KKH and 10 researchers at SciLifeLab. The program has expanded to include 14 artists and 30 researchers. Half of the artists are post-master’s students who are already practicing artists, and half are program students at KKH. This program connects the art and science communities in Stockholm with the aim of creating an opportunity for creative collaboration.

Researchers and artists participate in three events. The first event occurred on February 6th and was meant to introduce the scientists and artists, with quick pitch-presentations by everyone on their work and interests. The second event was a tour of the researchers’ workspaces, guided by each researcher and given to a small group of artists. If there is mutual interest between a scientist and artist after the lab tours, a collaborative project can be set up on their own terms. The resulting work will be featured in an exhibition at SciLifeLab at the end of April, which is the last event.

This program is be a unique opportunity for outreach at the SciLifeLab. It creates a dialog with artists, lets scientists see how their work and ideas can be visualized, and may lead to increased visibility of their research. For the artists, this program will allow collaboration with leading scientists, giving them the chance to gain inspiring insight at the forefront of research in the life sciences. This program is intended as a pilot, with the goal of being continued in the future, beyond this academic semester, creating compelling and bonding connections between the artistic and scientific communities in Stockholm.

Thank you to the Lois Roth Foundation for awarding me the Roth-Thompson award to support this project.

## Development of the program

In my Fulbright application, as my community engagement project, I proposed a collaboration with artists from the Royal Institute of Art (KKH) related to my research in Dr. Ilaria Testa’s lab. The goal was to engage with local artists in Stockholm. After meeting with KKH Professor Johanna Gustafsson Fürst in September and discussing my ideas with the external relations office at SciLifeLab, my community engagement project began to evolve.

Professor Fürst put me in contact with four other professors at KKH: Åsa Andersson Broms, Björn Larsson, Martin Christensen, and Rut Karin Zettergren. I met with them at KKH in October, where they gave me a tour of the art studios and we discussed the project. With the permission of Dr. Testa, Professors Broms, Zettergren, and Larsson toured my lab in November.

Early in December, I reached out to the SciLifeLab external relations team again and proposed a program connecting researchers at SciLifeLab and artists at the KKH. Inspired in part by the exhibition The Life of a Neuron at ARTECHOUSE in New York City, seen a week before I departed for Stockholm, as well as the exhibition Eternal Life at Liljevalchs, which I saw in October, I wanted to create a collaboration between artists and scientists on a scale larger than just my personal research. With approximately 700 researchers working at the Solna campus of SciLifeLab, it seemed like the perfect place for such a project to occur.

The external relations office at SciLifeLab was excited to support the program and has been helping me recruit scientists at the SciLifeLab. We have a news article, application form, and flyers, and we’re looking to select 10 researchers by January 9th. The art professors have written up a program description for KKH students and are selecting 10 artists, 5 post-masters and 5 program students, through their own application process by early January. On December 14th, I gave a presentation to a post-master’s course at the KKH, taught by Professors Broms and Larsson, to generate interest and explain the program, and on December 15th, I announced the program to researchers at SciLifeLab’s WinterFest.
