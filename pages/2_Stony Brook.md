I became particularly interested in the optical pumping experiment of my senior laboratory class. The experiment became the focus of my honors thesis.

[Optical Pumping: Exciting optical and RF transitions simultaneously to perform spectroscopy on the hyperfine splitting of the ground state of Rubidium](https://github.com/maxnfrankel/maxnfrankel.github.io/raw/master/pages/StonyBrook/Optical_Pumping.pdf)

I noticed a strange deformation of the microwave transition lineshape at high Rb density, and worked extensively to identify the cause. I am still trying to figure this one out.

# Ultracold Quantum Systems Group

At Stony Brook University, I worked in Professor Dominik Schneble's Ultracold Quantum Systems group, which performs experiments in quantum simulation with Bose Einstein Condensates of Rubidium. The group loads the condensates into optical lattices formed by counter-propagating beams. 

My undergraduate research was quite simple work in optics, focused on creating a system that would allow the group to subject the condensates to arbitrary potentials beyond than just an optical lattice. In the process, I learned about various optical elements, diffraction limited and high-NA imaging, and how to analyze image data and simulate Gaussian beam propagation in Mathematica.

What I was really interested in was understanding the experiments happening in Professor Schneble's lab, which I learned about through weekly group meetings, reading the group's publications, and speaking with Schneble and others in the lab. However, through my work, I came to greatly appreciate optics as an extremely important tool for every atomic physicist, and quite fascinating on its own.

I experimented with using a Digital Micromirror Device (DMD) to shape a laser beam reflected from its surface, following the [Master's thesis of Phillip J Zupancic](https://github.com/maxnfrankel/maxnfrankel.github.io/raw/master/pages/StonyBrook/zupancic_thesis.pdf) in Prof. Dr. Markus Greiner's lab at Harvard. In my first two semesters, I read through the thesis and worked to characterize the DMD and explore its beam-shaping capabilities. This was my first introduction to Fourier optics and spatial light modulators (SLM), which I continued on to study in my Fulbright research in the Testalab.

Below is a simple guide I wrote to operating the DMD I used, and some measurements I took exploring the blazed condition.

I eventually settled on imaging the DMD surface in a simple 4f configuration. In my last two semesters, I designed and tested a setup that maximized imaging resolution while fitting the geometric constraints of Professor Schneble's setup.
