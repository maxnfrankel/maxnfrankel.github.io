## Undergraduate Research: Stony Brook University

# Physics 445: Senior Lab Reports 

Here are two of the reports completed during my senior lab class at Stony Brook University. I became particularly interested in the optical pumping experiment as I noticed a strange deformation of the microwave transition lineshape at high Rb density, and worked extensively on this experiment outside of class to try and figure out the cause.

# Ultracold Quantum Systems Group

At Stony Brook University, I worked in Professor Dominik Schneble's Ultracold Quantum Systems group, which performs experiments in quantum simulation with Bose Einstein Condensates of Rubidium. The group loads the condensates into optical lattices formed by counter-propagating beams. My work was focused on creating a system that would allow the group to subject the condensates to arbitrary potentials beyond an optical lattice.
I experimented with using a Digital Micromirror Device (DMD) to shape a laser beam reflected from its surface. This was my first introduction to Fourier optics and Spatial Light Modulators (SLM), which I continued on to study in my Fulbright research in the Testalab.
