## Fulbright Research: SciLifeLab & Royal Institute of Technology

## Undergraduate Research: Stony Brook University

# Honors thesis

I became particularly interested in the optical pumping experiment of my senior laboratory class. The experiment became the focus of my honors thesis.

[Optical Pumping: Exciting optical and RF transitions simultaneously to perform spectroscopy on the hyperfine splitting of the ground state of Rubidium](./PHY445_Optical_Pumping_Max.pdf)

I noticed a strange deformation of the microwave transition lineshape at high Rb density, and worked extensively to identify the cause. I am still trying to figure this one out.

# NMR senior lab

# Ultracold Quantum Systems Group

At Stony Brook University, I worked in Professor Dominik Schneble's Ultracold Quantum Systems group, which performs experiments in quantum simulation with Bose Einstein Condensates of Rubidium. The group loads the condensates into optical lattices formed by counter-propagating beams. My work was focused on creating a system that would allow the group to subject the condensates to arbitrary potentials beyond an optical lattice.
I experimented with using a Digital Micromirror Device (DMD) to shape a laser beam reflected from its surface. This was my first introduction to Fourier optics and Spatial Light Modulators (SLM), which I continued on to study in my Fulbright research in the Testalab.
