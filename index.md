<h1> Hi, I'm Max Frankel! </h1>


![Profile picture](/pages/images/prof_pic.png){: .center style="float: right" width="25%"}

I'm an aspring physicist from New York City and currently a Fulbright researcher at SciLifeLab and the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden for the 2022-23 academic year. 

I am interested in everything Atomic/Molecular/Optical physics, particularly spectroscopy, ultracold atoms, microscopy, and spatial light modulators.

<h2> Overview of my academic background </h2>

I graduated in 2022 with a BS in physics and a specialization in optics from Stony Brook University. In my last two years at Stony Brook, I was part of the Ultracold Quantum Systems group, a lab doing experimental atomic physics research under Professor Dominik Schneble. Professor Schneble’s lab works with Bose-Einstein condensates to perform experiments in quantum simulation. 

My time in Schneble’s lab led me to develop a strong interest in optics and microscopy, which motivated me to apply for a Fulbright scholarship to work on a microscopy project Ilaria Testa’s Optical BioImaging group in Stockholm, Sweden.

After my year in Sweden, I began my PhD at CU Boulder in Jun Ye's group. I'm working on Sr2, one of the three Strontium atomic clock project in Ye's group.
