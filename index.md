<h1> Hi, I'm Max Frankel! </h1>


![Profile picture](/pages/images/prof_pic.png){: .center style="float: right" width="25%"}

I'm an aspring physicist from New York City and currently a Fulbright researcher at SciLifeLab and the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden for the 2022-23 academic year. 

I graduated in May 2022 with a BS in Physics and Specialization in Optics from Stony Brook University. I will be attending the Physics PhD program at CU Boulder in 2023.

I am interested in everything Atomic/Molecular/Optical physics, particularly spectroscopy, microscopy, spatial light modulators, and holography.
