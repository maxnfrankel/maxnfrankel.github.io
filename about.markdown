I graduated in May 2022 with a BS in Physics and Specialization in Optics from Stony Brook University. I was accepted to the Physics PhD program at CU Boulder and deferred to accept the Swedish Fulbright Research Award for the 2022-23 academic year. I am currently working in a research group at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden.

I am interested in Atomic/Molecular/Optical physics, particularly spectroscopy, microscopy, spatial light modulators, and holography.
